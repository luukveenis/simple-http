=========================
Changes since lab demo
=========================

Since my code was fully functional in the lab demo, not many changes were made
after. The only two changes made were:

1: I added error checking for invalid HTTP versions

    ie: GET http://www.example.com/index.html HTTP/0.0

    This should not be allowed since HTTP/0.0 is invalid. For this case, I
    added 500 errors to my server, since we did not have an appropriate error
    in the implementation. This use case was tested in the lab demo, so I
    provided a solution to it here. The client hardcodes the HTTP version, so
    the only way to trigger this behaviour is to modify the client source code
    where it builds the request. The server will also return a 500 error if no
    HTTP version is provided at all.

      ie: GET http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~wkui/index.html\r\n\r\n


2: I added a readme.txt file to my submission

  I did not provide this in the lab since we were demoing the code in person
  and I felt it was probably not necessary at the time. The readme provided now
  has detailed instructions on how to run my code.
