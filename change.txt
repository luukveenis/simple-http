Changes since lab demo
=========================

Since my code was fully functional in the lab demo, not many changes were made
after. The only two changes made were:

1: I added error checking for invalid HTTP versions

    ie: GET http://www.example.com/index.html HTTP/0.0

    This should not be allowed since HTTP/0.0 is invalid.


2: I added a readme.txt file to my submission

  I did not provide this in the lab since we were demoing the code in person
  and I felt it was probably not necessary at the time. The readme provided now
  has detailed instructions on how to run my code.
